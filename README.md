A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`, and example unit test in `test/`.


## Components

- main.dart: The code to display â€” for example, a working or nonworking method.
- test.dart (optional): A main() function that tests the above code. Also contains any classes, functions, constants,
  etc. to be used by main.dart but not displayed.

- solution.dart (optional): The ideal final state of main.dart, once the user has made all the changes you've asked
  them to make. The solution code is hidden until the user asks to see it.
- hint.txt (optional): A text hint that the user can request to see, to help them complete the exercise.
  Examples: "Try X or Y," "Have you considered Z."
